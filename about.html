                                </h2>
                                <p>“If dogs can speak I will never meet human friends. Kidding.” As an animal lover, I never stop finding ways to better their lives as they are easily neglected due to our increasingly fast-paced modernized lifestyle. We can make friends online and offline, but our beloved pets can’t. So I couldn’t help but wonder: how about we make a platform for them to meet friends? So here we are, and I am proud to introduce you to Tindog.
                                </p>

                                  <span class="section-heading-lower">Our Mission</span>
                                </h2>
                                <p>As a pet-friendly platform, we aim to offer quality dating services for dogs and other animals. Of course, when two users matched each other, it is the pet owners who get to know each other as well. Therefore, this platform can provide a “side-effect” for pet owners to meet new friends as well. Most importantly, the matched person in Tindog shared some very important similarities: they have a pet and they would like to help their pets to meet more friends. With the technological specialty and social networking services we are privileged to offer, our members are guaranteed to provide quality service for pet (dogs) dating service to you.
                                </p>

                                </h2>
                                <p>
                                  Pet dating services are rare to see. It is not difficult to understand why this happens as there are many available dating app platforms for humans. Yet, with the increasing number of adopted animals each year as a global phenomenon, it is, therefore, increasingly important to care more about our pets as they can, too, feel the need of meeting friends as we are. After years of research and trials and errors, we are confident to tell that the user number of Tindog is growing steadily. It is estimated that by the next quarter of 2022 the total will be about 3.3 million.</p>
                                <p>We are aspired to build a better community environment for pets locally and overseas.
                                </p>
